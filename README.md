# Greasemonkey-YouTube-Cookie-Denier
Automatically deny and dismiss cookie consent dialogs on YouTube using Greasemonkey

"YouTube Cookie Denier" helps to automatically deny and dismiss cookie consent dialogs on YouTube. The script is designed to simplify the browsing experience by automatically clicking on "Reject" or "Deny" buttons within pop-up dialogs that pertain to cookies. It accomplishes this by utilizing a MutationObserver to monitor changes in the web page's structure and then triggering the denial of cookie-related questions. This tool enhances user convenience by eliminating the need to interact with these consent dialogs manually.
